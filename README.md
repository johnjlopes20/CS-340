How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In developing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs, I focus on structuring code clearly and modularly. The CRUD Python module from Project One contained database operations, promoting code reuse and enhancing readability. Integrating it into Project Two's dashboard facilitated seamless database interaction, emphasizing its value in enhancing maintainability and versatility.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems with systematic problem-solving and leverage appropriate tools. For Grazioso Salvare's dashboard, this involved understanding requirements, designing a database schema, and implementing the interface. Future projects would benefit from agile methodologies and iterative development to meet evolving client needs efficiently.


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

I analyze, design, and implement solutions to computational problems, driving innovation and efficiency. My work on this project enables Grazioso Salvare to make data-driven decisions and streamline operations through centralized data access. This highlights the role of computer science in leveraging technology for organizational success in the digital era.
